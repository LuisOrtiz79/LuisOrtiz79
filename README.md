### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer with experience in computer science. My primary areas of expertise are back-end development and front-end development to a lesser extent. I have a minor in cybersecurity and a bachelor's degree in my area, so I know a little bit about everything.

### A little about me:

I take great satisfaction in being a committed, adaptable, and loving person who can work well both individually and in a group. I was born in Puerto Rico.

### Work Experience:

My mentor was more from a hospital, and I assisted them in cleaning some data and creating some graphs for a time-sensitive research paper they were working on during my brief summer internship at the University of Pittsburgh. Additionally, they needed some assistance cleaning up the data and creating some graphs, as well as modifying some Python code that one of their colleagues had given them so it could read several files.

### Where did I study 

I recently completed a three-month Ironhack Miami bootcamp virtually from Puerto Rico. It was a Web Developer bootcamp with a focus on HTML, CSS, and Javascript for basic page creation, followed by React and Node.js for more intricate and server-side interactive pages. Lastly, MongoDb is used to record any server-side modifications that are made while using React and Express on the client side. I chose the web development program because I was interested in learning more about honing my talents. I believe that pursuing this professional path is something I would like to accomplish.

Prior to that, I had just received my degree in computer science with a cybersecurity minor from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras.
